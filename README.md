Wyrm Team Briefing:

Welcome to the MegaCorp Counter-Espionage Team! Thank you for joining us today. Todayâ€™s mission -- We have reason to believe these agents have infiltrated the company and are stealing corporate secrets. We have obtained this list of code names they are operating under. 

The Comic
The Oddball
The Dude
The Painter
The Blues
The Hair
The Academy
The Grease
The Singer 
The Monster
The Nomad
The Fletch

Each Agent is receiving orders in files disguised as celebrity gossip or media - in order to trace these Agents back to their handlers, and update our security protocols, we need to identify the celebrity channels used to deliver orders to each Agent. Once we have identified the linkages, we will be able to subvert their communications and root out the entire organization. Your mission is to determine which Agent is operating under which handle, and which celebrity channel they are using to communicate under.

To Play:

docker build .
docker run -it [containerID]
Identify the links: Celebrity-Person-Codename
